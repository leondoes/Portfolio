export const TanadianCire = {
  SubTitle: `Tanadian Cire`,
  Body: `
  The Tanadian Cire store page marked a significant milestone in my journey as a developer. 
  It was the first major project I tackled independently, without relying on tutorials or courses. 
  It all started as a personal challenge where I set out to recreate a website from scratch.
  `,
  Body1: `At the outset, I was full of enthusiasm, but I soon realized the enormity of the task at hand. 
  So, I decided to narrow my focus specifically to the store page, with a special emphasis on enhancing its sorting functionality.
 `,
  Body2: `As I immersed myself in coding the store page, I came to understand that the best way to learn is through hands-on experience. 
  I dedicated time to grasp the art of writing modular, functional, and well-organized code. 
  This process provided me with valuable insights into effective code structuring. 
  The entire project took approximately 20 hours to complete. 
  If I were to do it again, I am confident I could accomplish it more efficiently and with greater confidence.`,
  Body3: `The store page operates by utilizing a "ProductGrid" component that employs the .map function to populate each card with data 
  from a simulated server (in this case, "data.js" filled with strings simulates the server's role). 
  This data is then displayed on the store page. 
  The two sorting components make use of built-in JavaScript functions to return a new array to the product grid, 
  preserving the integrity of the original data.
  `,
  Body4: `Overall, I'm quite pleased with what I've achieved here. Although the code could benefit from some cleanup (there are numerous side notes and other elements that aren't directly related), this personal project provided me with invaluable insights into website development. It has prepared me for what I can anticipate in a professional context, and I would gladly take on similar coding tasks in the future should the opportunity arise.`

export const ProfileNav = {
  Subtitle: `Profile Menu`,
  Body: `The Profile Menu project was a contracted assignment that I undertook. The client had an existing profile page built in HTML, and they were in the process of upgrading their website. They reached out to me to convert and enhance their profile menu.`,
  Body1: `The task was relatively straightforward, and I successfully completed the project in approximately 8 hours of work. The component operates by utilizing React state to determine what to display in the main view based on the user's selection from the menu. It retrieves the displayed information from the back-end. I provided the client with all the necessary components to seamlessly integrate the profile menu into their upgraded website. The end result is identical to their previous HTML build, but now utilizing React state and functionality, allowing for better integration with the rest of their website.`,
  Body2: `As the project involved sensitive client data, I respect their decision to maintain code privacy. However, I've included a demo of the profile menu in my portfolio to showcase its functionality. You can explore the demo below to get a glimpse of the features and capabilities of this component.`,
