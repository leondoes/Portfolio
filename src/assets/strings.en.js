export const TanadianCire = {
  Subtitle: `Tanadian Cire`,
  Body: `
  The Tanadian Cire store page marked a significant milestone in my journey as a developer. 
  It was the first major project I tackled independently, without relying on tutorials or courses. 
  It all started as a personal challenge where I set out to recreate a website from scratch.
  `,
  Body1: `At the outset, I was full of enthusiasm, but I soon realized the enormity of the task at hand. 
  So, I decided to narrow my focus specifically to the store page, with a special emphasis on enhancing its sorting functionality.
 `,
  Body2: `As I immersed myself in coding the store page, I came to understand that the best way to learn is through hands-on experience. 
  I dedicated time to grasp the art of writing modular, functional, and well-organized code. 
  This process provided me with valuable insights into effective code structuring. 
  The entire project took approximately 20 hours to complete. 
  If I were to do it again, I am confident I could accomplish it more efficiently and with greater confidence.`,
  Body3: `The store page operates by utilizing a "ProductGrid" component that employs the .map function to populate each card with data 
  from a simulated server (in this case, "data.js" filled with strings simulates the server's role). 
  This data is then displayed on the store page. 
  The two sorting components make use of built-in JavaScript functions to return a new array to the product grid, 
  preserving the integrity of the original data.
  `,
  Body4: `Overall, I'm quite pleased with what I've achieved here. Although the code could benefit from some cleanup (there are numerous side notes and other elements that aren't directly related), this personal project provided me with invaluable insights into website development. It has prepared me for what I can anticipate in a professional context, and I would gladly take on similar coding tasks in the future should the opportunity arise.`

export const ProfileNav = {
  Subtitle: `Profile Menu`,
  Body: `The Profile Menu project was a contracted assignment that I undertook. The client had an existing profile page built in HTML, and they were in the process of upgrading their website. They reached out to me to convert and enhance their profile menu.`,
  Body1: `The task was relatively straightforward, and I successfully completed the project in approximately 8 hours of work. The component operates by utilizing React state to determine what to display in the main view based on the user's selection from the menu. It retrieves the displayed information from the back-end. I provided the client with all the necessary components to seamlessly integrate the profile menu into their upgraded website. The end result is identical to their previous HTML build, but now utilizing React state and functionality, allowing for better integration with the rest of their website.`,
  Body2: `As the project involved sensitive client data, I respect their decision to maintain code privacy. However, I've included a demo of the profile menu in my portfolio to showcase its functionality. You can explore the demo below to get a glimpse of the features and capabilities of this component.`,

export const ReactRain = {
  Subtitle: `ReactRain`,
  Body: `ReactRain is a small weather application that allows users to retrieve up-to-date weather information for a city of their choice. This app serves as a practical demonstration of how to utilize an external weather API and display the resulting data in a user-friendly format.`,
  Body1: `Upon entering a city name, ReactRain fetches and sorts through the JSON data received from a weather API, providing users with valuable weather details such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind speed. It also displays a 2-day weather forecast for the selected location, offering a comprehensive overview of the weather conditions.`,
  Body2: `In addition, what sets ReactRain apart is its well-structured code, making it a valuable addition to any developer's portfolio. The code is organized, modular, and easy to understand, demonstrating best practices in React application development. Additionally, ReactRain features a responsive design, ensuring it can seamlessly fit into any website or mobile application, providing a consistent and visually pleasing weather experience on various devices.`

export const ReviewsAndQuestions = {
  Subtitle: `Reviews & Questions`,
  Body: `The "Reviews & Questions" project, a contract task completed for Mejuri, an online jewelry e-commerce store, was a challenging yet rewarding experience. My objective was to rebuild their Yotpo module, focusing on enhancing page load speeds, SEO, and conversion rates, all within a 15-hour timeframe.`,
  Body1: `The project involved reengineering Yotpo's existing modules, which, while powerful in leveraging customer reviews for engagement and sales, often suffered from slow website performance due to analytics and overly generic code. This task required careful attention to detail and a deep understanding of the module's impact on website efficiency.`,
  Body2: `By rewriting the component, I was able to integrate it seamlessly with the site's existing codebase, avoiding the performance issues associated with external modules. This code-sharing approach not only optimized performance but also maintained the website's aesthetic and functional consistency. I incorporated 'react-query' for efficient data fetching, management, and caching, enhancing the overall responsiveness and user experience.`,
  Body3: `In the portfolio demo, I crafted a mock version of the component to responsibly avoid real API calls on behalf of Mejuri. This rendition meticulously fetches the first 10 pages of customer reviews and questions, mirroring Mejuri's actual functionality. The mock-up replicates the pagination, question form (powered by 'react-form' for optimized form handling and validation), and overall ratings components, ensuring everything is identical to Mejuri's implementation. Moreover, I've placed a strong emphasis on responsiveness, ensuring that the component adapts seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes. This demo, complete with a 'phone view' and diverse testing controls, showcases not just the functionality, but also the precision and attention to detail in my development approach, inviting users to engage with a component that blends seamlessly with Mejuri's established web presence.`
