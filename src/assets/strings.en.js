  SubTitle: `Tanadian Cire`,
  Body: `
  The Tanadian Cire store page marked a significant milestone in my journey as a developer. 
  It was the first major project I tackled independently, without relying on tutorials or courses. 
  It all started as a personal challenge where I set out to recreate a website from scratch.
  `,
  Body1: `At the outset, I was full of enthusiasm, but I soon realized the enormity of the task at hand. 
  So, I decided to narrow my focus specifically to the store page, with a special emphasis on enhancing its sorting functionality.
 `,
  Body2: `As I immersed myself in coding the store page, I came to understand that the best way to learn is through hands-on experience. 
  I dedicated time to grasp the art of writing modular, functional, and well-organized code. 
  This process provided me with valuable insights into effective code structuring. 
  The entire project took approximately 20 hours to complete. 
  If I were to do it again, I am confident I could accomplish it more efficiently and with greater confidence.`,
  Body3: `The store page operates by utilizing a "ProductGrid" component that employs the .map function to populate each card with data 
  from a simulated server (in this case, "data.js" filled with strings simulates the server's role). 
  This data is then displayed on the store page. 
  The two sorting components make use of built-in JavaScript functions to return a new array to the product grid, 
  preserving the integrity of the original data.
  `,
  Body4: `Overall, I'm quite pleased with what I've achieved here. Although the code could benefit from some cleanup (there are numerous side notes and other elements that aren't directly related), this personal project provided me with invaluable insights into website development. It has prepared me for what I can anticipate in a professional context, and I would gladly take on similar coding tasks in the future should the opportunity arise.`
