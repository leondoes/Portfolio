        This personal project aimed to develop a store-type component
        with the capacity to retrieve data from a database and present
        it within a store interface. Additionally, I sought to implement
        sorting functionality for these items. My primary objective was
        to replicate the features of a well-established online retail
        platform, employing only React, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. While
        numerous components serve as placeholders, I take pride in my
        accomplishment of replicating the site and establishing a
        functional storefront.

        As a secondary goal, I endeavored to construct the entire
        project without relying on any libraries other than React. I
        pursued this approach for two significant reasons. Firstly, it
        presented a valuable challenge that allowed me to refine my
        skills. Secondly, it aligns with my philosophy that one should
        only introduce external dependencies when there is a compelling
        need, avoiding unnecessary additions. Utilizing a library, in
        this context, could have acted as a crutch.

        Finally, I developed components with a focus on enhancing
        reusability.
